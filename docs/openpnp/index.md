# OpenPnP

OpenPnP is a piece of open source software designed to control pick and place machines. It supports a wide range of machines, with many features found in high-end commercial software. You can find out more about it [here](https://openpnp.org/).

These guides were designed with OpenPnP version `2022-08-01_18-07-09.2a36a8d`, so the UI screenshots will match this version, but they should work for other versions as well (namely the [updated version of OpenPnP used for feeders](../feeders/3-software-update/software-update.md)).
