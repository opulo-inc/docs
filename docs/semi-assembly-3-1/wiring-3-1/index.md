# Wiring

In this step, you will mount and connect all the wiring and pneumatic tubing.

## Installing Front Drag Chain Mount

1. Find the `front-drag-chain-mount` print in the first tray, and grab a M5x25mm socket head screw from the hardware bag.
  ![Drag Train Mount print with screw](images/front-leg-cable-chain-mount.webp)

2. Place the `front-drag-chain-mount` on top of the front left leg as shown.
  ![Positioning the drag train mount](images/front-cable-chain-mount-placement.webp)

3. Insert the M5x25mm socket head screw through the print into the front left leg before tightening it down with an allen wrench.

## Installing Drag Chain Assembly

4. Grab the cable harness from the first tray. One side of the cable chain will have shorter wires, and the other will have longer wires with a print zip tied to it. Place your harness as shown in the image below.
  ![Cable harness](images/cable-harness.webp)

5. Check the clip holding the cable that exits the cable chain part way through. If it has popped out during shipping, press it back into place.
  ![Check cable harness clip](images/x-motor-cable-pop.webp)
  ![Reattach cable harness clip](images/x-motor-cable-set.webp)

6. Lift up the harness and place it onto your machine as shown below. Place the side of the cable chain with the longer wires on the ledge in the `front-drag-chain-mount`. It can help to pull your Y gantries forward to give the right side of the harness a place to rest for the next few steps.
  ![Cable harness installed](images/cable-harness-placement-1.webp)
  ![Cable harness installed 2](images/cable-harness-placement-2.webp)

7. Screw two M5x10mm socket head screws through the mounting holes in the cable chain and into the `front-drag-chain-mount`. (This may be a tight fit.) If you notice that a cable chain clip pops out at any point, it can easily be pressed right back into place.

  ![Left motor cable plugged in](images/plug-lh.webp)

1.  Tighten left Z gantry zip tie to secure the LM cable in place.

    !!! danger "This zip tie is not optional"
        This zip tie provides critical strain relief for the cable harness and motor connector. Failure to do so will result in excessive wear on your cable harness. Please be sure that you install it.

    ![Zip tie securing left motor cable](images/zip-lh-4.webp)

    !!! danger "Warning"
        Be sure to secure the zip tie **around the thicker black insulation of the cable**. Failure to do so will cause undue stress on the cabling, which can result in the cable failing. Be sure to secure the zip tie securly around the black insulation, and not around the four individual wires within.

        ![incorrect cable mounting](images/incorrect-cable.webp)

2.  Find the cable labeled `RM` and secure it in place using the zip tie on the right side of the X gantry.

    !!! danger "Secure zip tie loosely"
        When tightening the zip tie, do **not** tighten it fully. Tighten until there's about a 15mm diameter opening as shown below. If the zip tie is tightened too tightly, it can cause excessive wear to the cabling.

    ![LM cable secured](images/loose-zip-right.webp)

3.  Fit a zip tie through the outer slot on the right Z gantry.

4.  Plug the cable labeled `RM` into the right motor on the X gantry. This cable is inserted from the bottom.
    ![Plug in Right motor cable](images/plug-rh.webp)

5.  Tighten the right Z gantry zip tie to secure the RM cable in place.

    !!! danger "This zip tie is not optional"
        This zip tie provides critical strain relief for the cable harness and motor connector. Failure to do so will result in excessive wear on your cable harness. Please be sure that you install it.

    ![Right motor cable secured with zip tie](images/zip-rh-3.webp)

    !!! danger "Warning"
        Be sure to secure the zip tie **around the thicker black insulation of the cable**. Failure to do so will cause undue stress on the cabling, which can result in the cable failing.

## Installing Feeder Slots

The next step is installing the Feeder Slot Cable Harness. Select the appropriate installation instructions linked below based off your machine version.

  * If your machine is a `v3.1`, [install the harness for Individual Feeder Slots](../../feeders/2-install-harness/feeder-slot/index.md#install-the-harness).
  * If your machine is a `v3.2` or greater, [install the harness for Feeder Slot Blades](../../feeders/2-install-harness/feeder-blade/index.md#install-the-harness).

After you complete this step return to this page for guidance on plugging in the last few wires in the next section.
