## **What you'll learn**

This guide is focused on performing basic calibration for your LumenPnP. Specifically it will test the motion system, and calibrate the cameras so that they can identify objects and apply offsets to the toolhead for precise part picking and placing. These steps are usually only necessary when first setting up a LumenPnP for the first time.

## **What you'll need**

- A LumenPnP with the mechanical and electrical build completed.
- Read through the [OpenPnP Wiki](https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/wiki/User-Manual). It'll be super important to getting going with your machine. **These docs are meant to augment the OpenPnP docs, not replace them.**
